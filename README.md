Joon is a capacity development platform for producer groups with limited income resources. We are aiming to facilitate the socio-economic participation of people such as women, people with disabilities and immigrants, who cannot sustain their livelihood because of external reasons.

In this project it is aimed to solve the problems of both designers and beneficiaries. In order to solve, a new mobile app is designed. This project is designed for Innovation Hackathon between 25-27 September.
